#### Avoiding common attacks

1. Simplicity and minimalism: I used simpler codes that are easier to analyse and test. This reduces the possibility of bugs which can serve as loophole for attack

2. Use of openzepellin libraries: I used openzeppelin libraries that have been verified and tested on security.

3. Code quality: High code quality to ensure it is bug free
