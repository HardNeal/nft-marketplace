#### Design pattern

- Circuit breaker design pattern
  A circuit breaker, emergency stop pattern, is used to stop the execution of functions inside the smart contract. A circuit breaker can be triggered manually by trusted parties included in the contract like the contract admin or by using programmatic rules that automatically trigger the circuit breaker when the defined conditions are met. This allows time for the contract ownwer to fix bugs that can lead to attack.
